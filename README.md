RPG Fitness app
The purpose of this app is to create a workout app with a twist. 
The app should allow you to record your workouts and also measure your stat levels.

If you have ever played an RPG game with typical stat levels (like strength, agililty, endurance...) and thought to yourself 
"wouldn't it be nice if I could find out what my stats are?" Thats what this app will do. By inputing the wieght you can lift, how much you can lift multiple times, how far you can run, and how fast you are this app will tell you what your stats are. Currently I am thinking that the average adult human will have a base stat of 20 and the world records will be at a stat level of 100.  Also, just like in an RPG game your "build" will have an effect on your stats. A 5'5"  140 lb man will probably never get into high levels of strength but will more than likely have a higher agility then a 6'4" 250 lb man and vice versa. The goal of the app is to help get a person to higher stats but know going in that not everyone can attain ultra high stats in everything (unless you are Chuck Norris).


Strength -- Will be a combination of 3 excersizes - deadlift, squat, and benchpress. And it will be base on a 1 rep max.
Constitution - this will be based on BMI or body fat percentage
Dextarity -- how fast you can run 40 yards
Endurance -- will also be based on deadlift, squat, and benchpress and how much wieght you can lift 10 times. (may also factor in your  wieght, i.e. a 200lb man benching 300 pounds 10 times may be equivalent to a 180 pound man benching 270 pounds 10 times)
Stamina - how far you can run on a normal basis with bonus stats for doing marathons.
Wisdom - I may put this in for fun but it will not really be used for anything tangible (i.e. how many books do you read in a year, how often you work out...)
